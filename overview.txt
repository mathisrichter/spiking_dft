General questions
----------------
- how do DFT concepts translate to spiking dynamics?
  * attractor
  * repellor
  * bistability
  * instability

- parameter constraints for dynamic regimes
  * number of neurons
  * resting level
  * spiking threshold
  * synaptic strength (this and above are all interdependent)
  * time scales
  * spike rates!

- synchronization of firing
  * within recurrent population
  * across populations connected along a chain

- (refactoring the code)
  * creating plotting functions
  * centralized standard parameters that may be overwritten


0D
----------------
- detection, hysteresis             WORKING
- self-sustained                    WORKING


1D
----------------
- multi peak                        WORKING
- multi peak, peak fusion           NO FUSION!
- selection, hysteresis             WORKING
- sustained, multi peak, repulsion  WORKING
- sustained, selection              WORKING
- sustained, tracking               WORKING


2D
----------------
! time course plot (maybe projected to 1D?)
- multi peak

3D (maybe only multiple 2D slices?)
----------------
! time course plot (use 2D plots?)
